# assignment_3_coen_244

This is a sample library referencing program made in the scope of COEN 244.
All the requiered functions are implemented and, as usual, attention is given to user-friendly printing.
Due to the presence of ANSI Color Keys, the printing strategies may not be supported by your Terminal App. Please consult sample_output.pdf for intended result.

As per my visit with Pr. Hamou-Lhadj; the vector implementation of the required constant size array of objects Reference is valid. 

Best,

PS: The use of long int for the ISBN might seem odd since no operation is intended on this number. But the Binary Representation uses 64bits of memory compared to a String Representation's 128bits.
Built on macOS Catalina 10.15.2 (19C57).
